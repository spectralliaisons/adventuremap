Display KML, images, audio on Google Maps.

How to add a map:

1. Create directories:

a. `gps/Places/{{PLACE NAME}}/`
  `/info_template.json`
    -- basic map style for this place, e.g.:
      `{
        "zoom":15,
        "center":"head of the russian river",
        "mapType":"hybrid",
        "locations":[
          {
            "label":"head of the russian river",
            "loc":{"lat": 39.3816387, "lng": -123.2364948},
            "img":null,
            "aud":null
          }
        ]
      }`
  `/info.json`
    -- this is the data file for placing images, audio, KML on Google Maps. It is generated by `gps/python/create gps info.ipynb`
    -- if your directories are syntactically kosher, this python script will generate info.json files for every directory in gps/Places/

b. `gps/Places/{{PLACE NAME}}/img/`
  -- image files you want to place on map. If the python script finds GPS coordinates in the image, it will create a map marker on the map that, when clicked, will show the image, image name, and an audio file if one is found with the same name as this image.

c. `gps/Places/{{PLACE NAME}}/aud/`
  -- audio files. File name sans extension must match an image with valid GPS coordinates or else will not appear.
